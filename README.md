# **Grocery Budget App**

## Portfolio Project

### PGA

### Origins
The impetus of the project started as an attempt to create a grocery list app, similar to ones I use regularly, with a twist: the budget element that I could never find in the other apps. The true realization of the project will obviously be in the mobile app department, so during the React Native section of NuCamp's Full Stack program I intend to stretch this into a more useful app.

### Technologies
1. Docker Compose
2. Django (using Bootstrap currently -- React eventually)
3. PostGreSQL via pg_admin
4. Python for all backend Django work
5. Git Hub
